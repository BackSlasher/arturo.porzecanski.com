Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of my brother, Yehoshua (Shuki) Raz, we have several extensive family trees.  They contain information about the Porzecanski, the Kochmann, the Halpern and the Wertheim sides of my extended family.  While they can be found throughout the text of this website, we offer them here for your convenience.  We have also obtained and scanned several old photographs of family members, which can be seen by clicking the link on that person&#8217s name from his or her family tree.  We welcome any other old photographs that you may have.  Enjoy!<br>
