<h1>St. Petersburg: Church of the Resurrection of Christ<hr></h1>
<font size="3">
<div align="justify">
Although only one of many cathedrals and churches in St. Petersburg, and not one of the most important ones at that, the Church of the Resurrection of Christ caught our attention because it is so typical of the whimsical, onion-domed churches one sees at the Kremlin in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia.  It was built in the late 1800s on the spot where Emperor Alexander II was killed by a terrorist group in 1881.  As can be seen from the pictures of the inside of the church, every wall and ceiling is painted or otherwise lavishly decorated.
